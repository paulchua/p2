Project Discription:
This project is to help us learn PHP, the parameters I choose was between 1 to 9 words (validated server side) and the option for the user to specify if they would like to append either an integer, symbol, or both.  Everything is done on the server side with no client side processing.  The only thing I wasn't sure of was if I could use repeat of words, I didn't do that component since I didn't see that as a restriction.
